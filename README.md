# STAT 478: MLB Player Salary Analysis (1987)

## Project Overview
This group project applies multiple linear regression to analyze Major League Baseball player salaries from 1987. The analysis investigates which performance statistics and player characteristics best predict salary, providing insights into player valuation during this era of baseball.

## Research Question
What factors best predict MLB player salaries in 1987, and how do different performance metrics contribute to player compensation?

## Data
- **MLB Player Data (1987)**: Salaries and performance statistics
- **Variables**: Batting statistics, pitching statistics, fielding metrics, years of experience, and other player attributes

## Methodology

### Statistical Approach
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Model salary as a function of multiple predictor variables
- **Variable Selection**: Identify most significant predictors of salary
- **Model Diagnostics**: Check assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence)
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate different model specifications

### Analysis Steps
1. Exploratory data analysis and visualization
2. Correlation analysis among variables
3. Model building and variable selection
4. Residual analysis and diagnostic checks
5. Model interpretation and validation

## Technologies Used
- **R**: Statistical computing and regression analysis
- **R Markdown**: Reproducible research and reporting
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization
- **Statistical Methods**: Multiple regression, hypothesis testing, model diagnostics

## Key Findings
The analysis reveals which player statistics (e.g., batting average, home runs, RBIs, years of experience) were most strongly associated with salary in 1987, providing historical perspective on player valuation in professional baseball.
